# StratiPHOLIAGE
Stratified Photosynthesis and Light Absorption Model

## Details

This is a model that calculates light absorption and photosynthesis for trees in closed canopies.

## Implementation details

### Lazarus / Delphi

The original version was written in Delphi. This is the version ported to Lazarus / FPC.

Main functional changes
- Supports Linux, Windows and more.
- Graphing in tab 'Results' has been removed (too much hassle to port)
- Results (for now?) are similar but not identical -> needs further investigation
- Reads in *.xls, *.xlsx, and *.odt files natively (used Excel OLE automation before)

For further details, see the changelog.
